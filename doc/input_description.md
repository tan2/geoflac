### Notes:

1. This document is in Markdown format and is best viewed online at [this link](https://github.com/tan2/geoflac/doc/input_description.md).

2. Any number of comment lines can be present and are preceded by a semi-colon.

3. If the line contains more than one parameter, the parameters are separated by spaces and/or optional comma.

4. The parameter name is directly taken from the source code. Due to markdown syntax, some parameter names that contain '_' (underscore) are replaced with '-' (hyphen).

5. Parameters in italic are repeated for #lines based on the prior parameter. E.g.,

    **n**

    **_value1(i), value2(i),_** .... (this item repeats **n** times. If **n**=0, then NO italic line should be given.)

6. All parameters are in **SI units** (meter, kilogram, second, Pascal, ...), unless specified. The temperature is in Celsius.

## MESH PARAMETERS

| Parameters  | Types |  Description  |
|:------------|:-----:|:--------------|
|**nex, nez** | 2 int | # of *elements* in X and Z directions.|
|**x0, z0** | 2 dbl | Beginning coordinates (Upper Left).|
|**rxbo, rzbo** | 2 dbl | Size: width from left (positive), vertical thickness (negative), or coordinate value of Lower Right corner (depth is negative).|
|**ircoord, coordfile** | int,str | if **ircoord**=1, read the initial coordinates from the file.|

* In each direction of the mesh, #nodes = #elems + 1 (one more nodes than elements or cells), i.e. **nx** = **nex**+1 and **nz** = **nez**+1.
* First three lines define element spacing of uniform grid. dx = **(rxbo-x0)/nex**, dz = **(rzbo-z0)/nez**. In general, it is good to have dx = dz (square elements).
* The **coordfile**, if exists, should contain **nx*nz** lines of (x, z) coordinates.


| Parameters  | Types |  Description  |
|:------------|:-----:|:--------------|
|**nzonx** (>=0) | int | #Zones in X-direction (0-uniform grid, max 10).|
|**_nelz-x(i), sizez-x(i)_** | int,dbl | #Elems in this zone, size of zone (non-dimensional; percentage of **rxbo**). Sum of all **nelz-x(i)** must == **nex**; sum of all **sizez-x(i)**= 1.0).|
|**nzony** (>=0) | int | #Zones in Z-direction (0-uniform grid, max 10).|
|**_nelz-y(i), sizez-y(i)_** | int,dbl | #Elems in this zone, size of zone (non-dimensional; percentage of **rzbo**). Sum of all **nelz-y(i)** must = **nez**; sum of all **sizez-y(i)** = 1.0).|

## MECHANICAL CONDITIONS

|:------------|:-----:|:--------------|
|**nystressbc, nydrsides** | 2 int | Stress boundary conditions, lithostatic stress BC on the sides.       Both are 0-No, 1-Yes.|
|**nofbc** | int | # of boundary conditions (i.e., how many segments, max 20).|

* There are four sides (**nofside**) for a rectangular domain. 1-left, 2-bottom, 3-right, 4-top. Additional special situation: 5 for push at mid-plate.
* Each side is composed of one or more segments.  Each segment with its own BC behavior.  The starting and ending nodes of each segment are **nbc1** and **nbc2**.
* When **nofside**=5, the plate between i=[**nbc1**,**nbc2**] and j=[1,moho_grid * 2] is pushed at a constant velocity Vx. (**nbc** must be 10 in this case.)
* These are the following types of boundary conditions (**nbc**):
    +  1 - velz
    +  2 - shear stress (x,z) plane
    + 10 - velx 
    + 20 - normal stress
    + 30 - vely (strike slip version). (Experimental, used at your own risk.)
    + 40 - shear stress out of the plane. (Experimental, used at your own risk.)
    + 50 - velx with visc-dep profile. (Experimental, used at your own risk.)
* If the BC is a velocity in x or z, it is provided in units of meters/sec, a very small number.  For reference, 1 mm/year = 1 km/myr = 3.17E-11 m/s.
* The BC function **fbc(s) = a + b S + c S^2 + (d cos (2pi e S) + f sin (2pi g S))*exp(-(S - i)^2 h^2 )** is measured *along this segment* as the length ratio. **S** is normalized between 0~1, i.e. **S** = (node-in-segment - **nbc1**) / (**nbc2** - **nbc1**).

| Parameters  | Types |  Description  |
|:------------|:-----:|:--------------|
|**nyhydro,pisos,iphsub,drosub,damp-vis**| int,dbl,int,2 dbl | Winkler-type boundary condition, ie. the bottom boundary is open for flow passing through in and out. Effectively, the bottom is supported by an inviscid fluid.  See below. |
|**g**| dbl | Acceleration of gravity.  (typically 9.81 or 10).|

## INITIAL STRUCTURE

| Parameters  | Types |  Description  |

    + 2: oceanic geotherm (plate cooling model). **age-1** is the  thermal age (Myrs) of the plate. **tp1** is the plate thickness (km).

* **ixtb1, ixtb2**: left and right side of zone in nodes.
* If two consequent zones have the same phases and **ixtb2**=-1 for the former zone and **ixtb1**=-1 for the later zone, the depths of layer interfaces and thermal ages will gradualy change within the two zones.


## PHASES & RHEOLOGY

There are some phases (rock types) that are defined for this code (see phases.f90).  Users can add 5 more.  Users should not override these original 16 phases, because they are involved in phase changes (see change\_phase.f90 for details).

The predefined phases are:

 1.  basalt (anhydrate)
 2.  continental crust,  same as #6.
 3.  basalt (oceanic crust), same as #7.
 4.  olivine (mantle),  same as #8.
 5.  schist, transformed from #17
 6.  continental crust, same as #2.
 7.  basalt (oceanic crust), same as #3.
 8.  olivine (mantle), same as #4.
 9.  serpentinite (weak mantle), transformed from mantle (#4, #8) if residing above subducted oceanic crust and sediment (#3, #7, #10).  Will transform to hydrated mantle (#16) when T-P conditions are high enough.
10. sedimentary rock, compacted from (#11)
11. sediment, uncompacted, generated by erosion.
12. weak continental crust, transformed from continental crust (#2, #6) if residing above oceanic crust, sediment, or arc (#3, #7, #10, #14).
13. eclogite, transformed from basal (#1, #3, #7) when T-P conditions are high enough.
14. arc crust, generated by arc volcanism
15. weak middle crust, transformed from continental crust (#3, #7) if stressed and heated. Disabled.
16. hydrated mantle, will transform (partially melt) to mantle (#4) if warmer than olivine wet solidus and generate arc (#14) at surface.
17. metamormpic sedimentary rock, transformed from (#10)

Phase changes are activated and will take place among certain of the defined phases.

* When oceanic crust (#3, #7, #10, #14) subducts under continent (#2, #6), this original continent crust  becomes "weak". cont. crust #2, #6 ----> #12 weak crust
* When oceanic crust (#3, #7, #10) is subducted under overlying mantle (#4, #8) (e.g., mantle wedge),  this overlying mantle will serpentinize.  This serpentinite will transform back to #16 when brought to greater depth, and further transform back to #4 if partially melted. ocean mantle #4, #8 ---->  #9 serpentini ----> #16 hydrated mantle -> #4 mantle
* Basalt (oceanic crust) will transform into eclogite. basalt (oceanic crust) #1, #3, #7 ----> #13 eclogite
* Erosion produces sediments (#11) at top layer ----> low (P,T) conditions compaction and diagenesis to sedimentary rock (#10) ----> medium (P,T) condition to metamorphic sedimentary rock (#17) ----> high (P,T) condition to schist (#5)
